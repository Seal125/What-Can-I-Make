# What Can I Make?

## What is it?

What Can I Make is an app where you can type in some ingredients you have at home, and you'll get back a
list of reipes that you can take a look at and make! Nothing more, nothing less. It's helpful for those who need to use up ingredients they have at home, or for those who have forgotten to go grocery shopping and need a quick idea.

**Disclaimer:** The API does not come with recipe URL's, or a full list of ingredients. It only shows recipes
that you can make from the ingredients you pass in, as well as how to prepare the ingredients you have. If you would like to look at the recipe in detail, you'll have to search up the name!

## How to run the app

You can clone this repo if you'd like. Make sure to run `npm i`.
Once you have everything installed, `cd` into the directory `what-can-i-make`, and run `npm start`.
Enjoy!
